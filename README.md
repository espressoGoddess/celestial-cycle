## Abstract: 

Celestial Cycle offers a seamless experience for users to input and track their menstrual flow, mood, cravings, and symptoms, alongside providing a glimpse of their daily horoscope and the current moon phase. Beyond these features, the app compiles this data to provide a comprehensive summary of insights, drawing on both the user's physical and emotional states, and the celestial influences at play in their life. By harmonizing this information, Celestial Cycle empowers users with a deeper understanding of themselves and their place within the universe, ultimately guiding them towards improved well-being and self-discovery.
